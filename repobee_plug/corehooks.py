"""Hookspecs for repobee core hooks.

Core hooks provide the basic functionality of repobee. These hooks all have
default implementations, but are overridden by any other implementation. All
hooks in this module should have the `firstresult=True` option to the hookspec
to allow for this dynamic override.

        """Generate :py:class:`~repobee_plug.containers.ReviewAllocation`
        tuples from the provided teams, given that this concerns reviews for a
        single master repo.

        The provided teams of students should be treated as units. That is to
        say, if there are multiple members in a team, they should always be
        assigned to the same review team. The best way to merge two teams 
        ``team_a`` and ``team_b`` into one review team is to simply do:

        .. code-block:: python
            
            team_c = apimeta.Team(members=team_a.members + team_b.members)

        This can be scaled to however many teams you would like to merge. As a
        practical example, if teams ``team_a`` and ``team_b`` are to review
        ``team_c``, then the following
        :py:class:`~repobee_plug.containers.ReviewAllocation` tuple, here
        called ``allocation``, should be contained in the returned list.

        .. code-block:: python

            review_team = apimeta.Team(members=team_a.members + team_b.members)
            allocation = containers.ReviewAllocation(
                review_team=review_team,
                reviewed_team=team_c,
            )

        .. note::

            Respecting the ``num_reviews`` argument is optional: only do it if
            it makes sense. It's good practice to issue a warning if
            num_reviews is ignored, however.

        Args:
            team: A list of :py:class:`~repobee_plug.apimeta.Team` tuples.
            num_reviews: Amount of reviews each student should perform (and
                consequently amount of reviewers per repo)
        Returns:
            A list of :py:class:`~repobee_plug.containers.ReviewAllocation` tuples.
