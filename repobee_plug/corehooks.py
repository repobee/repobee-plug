"""Hookspecs for repobee core hooks.

Core hooks provide the basic functionality of repobee. These hooks all have
default implementations, but are overridden by any other implementation. All
hooks in this module should have the `firstresult=True` option to the hookspec
to allow for this dynamic override.
